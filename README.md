# PyBer_Analysis

PURPOSE
____________
The purpose of the analysis is to compare the amount of rides, the fare of each ride for the customer, the total fares amount and how much fare is received by the driver in each city type setting (Urban, Suburban and Rural).

RESULTS
____________
 The rural city type has the least amount of rides in this timeframe with a count of 125 rides. There are also the smallest amount of drivers with a count of 78 drivers from January 2019 to April 2019. The average fare is $34.62 which is the highest in comparison to the other city types, and the average fare per driver is the highest with an average of $55.49 a driver; this is most likely due to the shortage of drivers in the rural areas.
 
 The suburban city type falls within the median of the results with regards to the total rides which accounted for 625 ride from January 2019 to April 2019; there is a substantial increase in drivers from the rural city type to 490 drivers, and the toal fare up from $4,327.93 in rural cities to $19,356.33 in suburban cities. The average fare per ride is $30.97 and the average fare per driver is $39.50.
 
 The urban city type has the highest amount of rides with a sum of 1,625 rides during this timeframe with the highest total fare at $39,854.38. The average total fare is the lowest of the city types at $24.53 with the driver fare at $16.57 a ride. This lower fare is most likely due to the saturation of drivers in urban areas and potentially the shorter length of the rides.
